## About this project

This is a reimplementation of the PCI serial protocol _from scratch_. This is
done using a combination [Clipsal's _Open C-Bus_ documentation][clipsal-docs]
and reverse engineering (to fill in the gaps).

Unlike some contemporary alternatives, it does **not** use the `libcbm`
library/DLL from Clipsal, or C-Gate, which have serious problems:

* The `libcbm` module is written in C, and does not support `x86_64` or
  comparatively-modern ARM architectures (such as that used in the Raspberry
  Pi).

  `libcbm` was previously only available as a static library for `x86_32` Linux
  and Windows systems. [Source is available][libcbm-src] under the Boost
  license, but this was last updated in 2009.

* C-Gate requires an OS and architecture specific closed source serial
  library (SerialIO), the Java runtime, and itself has various licensing
  restrictions.

Because this is a pure-Python implementation, it should run on any Python
supported platform. It has been primarily developed on Linux on `armhf`,
`x86_32` and `x86_64` and macOS on `x86_64`.

At a high level, this project includes `cmqttd`, a daemon to bridge a C-Bus PCI
to an MQTT Broker. `cmqttd` supports Home Assistant's
[MQTT Light model][ha-mqtt] and [MQTT topic auto-discovery][ha-auto].

_Integration with Hass.io is still a work in progress._

## Docker Setup

This project includes Docker support for easy deployment. To use it:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file to match your configuration:
   ```
   # Timezone
   TZ=Your/Timezone

   # MQTT Settings
   MQTT_USE_TLS=0
   MQTT_SERVER=your-mqtt-server.example.com

   # C-Bus Settings
   CMQTTD_PROJECT_FILE=your-project.cbz
   CNI_ADDR=192.168.x.y:10001
   CMQTTD_CBUS_NETWORK=Your Network
   ```

3. Build and start the container:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TZ` | Timezone for the container | `Australia/Sydney` |
| `MQTT_USE_TLS` | Whether to use TLS for MQTT connection (0=no, 1=yes) | `0` |
| `MQTT_SERVER` | MQTT broker address | `mqtt.example.com` |
| `CMQTTD_PROJECT_FILE` | C-Bus Toolkit project backup file | `project.cbz` |
| `CNI_ADDR` | C-Bus PCI address and port | `192.168.1.10:10001` |
| `CMQTTD_CBUS_NETWORK` | C-Bus network name | `My Network` |

The `.env` file is excluded from version control to keep your configuration private.

## Hardware interface support

This should work with the following C-Bus PC Interfaces (PCIs):

* [5500PC Serial PCI][5500PC]

* [5500PCU USB PCI][5500PCU]

  On Linux, this requires v2.6.25 or later kernel, with the `cp210x` module.

* [5500CN Ethernet PCI][5500CN] (and likely _also_ [5500CN2][])

  This software _does not_ support configuring the Ethernet PCI for the first
  time. It must already have an IP address on your network.

## C-Bus Simulator

For testing purposes, a C-Bus simulator is available in the `cbus-simulator` subdirectory. 
This can be used to simulate a C-Bus PCI without needing actual hardware. 
See the README.md file in that directory for more details.

## Recent updates (2020-02-22)

This project has recently completed a migration to Python 3.7.

Most things should work, but I'm still going through updating all the documentation properly.

There are many backward-incompatible changes:

* This _only_ supports Python 3.7 and later.

* Python 2.x support _has been entirely removed_, [as Python 2 has been sunset as of 2020][py2].

  Python 3.6 and earlier support is not a goal. We want to use new language features!

* D-Bus is no longer used by this project:

  * `cmqttd` (C-Bus to MQTT bridge) replaces `cdbusd` (C-Bus to D-Bus bridge).

  * `dbuspcid` (virtual PCI to D-Bus bridge) has been removed. It has no replacement.

* `sage` (libcbus' web interface) and `staged` (scene management system) have been removed.
  `cmqttd` supports [Home Assistant's MQTT Discovery schema][ha-auto].

  This allows `libcbus` to reduce its scope significantly -- Home Assistant can interface with much
  more hardware than C-Bus, and has a large community around it.

* This no longer uses Twisted -- `asyncio` (in the standard library) is used instead.

Many APIs have changed due to refactoring, and is subject to further change without notice. The
most stable API is via MQTT (`cmqttd`).
